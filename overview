The process starts with two technical screening, one. SQL(expect two intermediate question with follow up question) screen share and one case study. If you clear both then the on-site is mostly focused around intermediate SQL and R/Python, stats and A/B testing, Statistical modelling (pretty basic ones like linear, logistic and KNN and little bit of random forest), case study (not really any stucture for this). Hope it's helpful.

This is the engineering/infra track. If you want the ML track make sure you’re interviewing with track 2. DS is not standard ML engineering but there’s a track who focuses more on it vs standard ab testing etc
